* check out the [user guide](https://sites.google.com/site/gson/gson-user-guide)  
* try the [array](https://sites.google.com/site/gson/gson-user-guide#TOC-Array-Examples) and [collection examples](https://sites.google.com/site/gson/gson-user-guide#TOC-Collections-Examples)
* convert your own data


### resources

* [gson home](http://code.google.com/p/google-gson/)
* a [slightly longer tutorial](http://www.mkyong.com/java/how-do-convert-java-object-to-from-json-format-gson-api/)
* something [more real-worldly](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/604719/Java-JSON-mapping-with-GSON)
* if you don't need object mapping look at [minimal-json](https://github.com/ralfstx/minimal-json)
* for anything more advanced you'll want [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson)
